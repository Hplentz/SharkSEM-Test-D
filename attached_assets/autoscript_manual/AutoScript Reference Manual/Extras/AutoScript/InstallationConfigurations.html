<h1>Installation Configurations</h1>

Two essential components of the AutoScript product are <strong>the server</strong> and <strong>the client</strong>.
The product installer provides the possibility to install these components in different configurations with respect to the 
typical network architecture of SEM systems.
The specifics of each configuration are described below.

<h2>Remote scripting configuration</h2>

This is the preferred and most common installation configuration for systems with a standalone <strong>Support PC</strong>,
which is connected to the <strong>Microscope PC</strong> via the Support network.

<p><img height="229" src="Resources/RemoteScripting.png" width="622" alt=""></p>

The AutoScript server component is installed on the Microscope PC and the client is installed on the Support PC
along with the <a href="PythonDistribution.html">Python distribution</a> and <a href="PyCharm.html">PyCharm Editor</a>.<br>
Python scripts are executed on the Support PC, passing the IP address of the Microscope PC to the <a href="../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/SdbMicroscopeClient/connect.html">connect()</a>
function on the <a href="../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/SdbMicroscopeClient/SdbMicroscopeClient.html">SdbMicroscopeClient</a> object.<br>
The advantage of this configuration is that the Python development environment does not interfere with the rest of
the microscope software ecosystem on the Microscope PC. 


<h2>Local scripting configuration</h2>

In this configuration, all product components are installed on the <strong>Microscope PC</strong> and the Python scripts are
executed from there.<br>

<p><img height="229" src="Resources/LocalScripting.png" width="392" alt=""></p>

The <a href="../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/SdbMicroscopeClient/SdbMicroscopeClient.html">SdbMicroscopeClient</a>
object must be connected to the locally running server with the hostname "localhost",
as described in the <a href="../UserGuide/ClientStartup.html">User guide</a>.
<br>
This is not a preferred configuration, it is often used as a workaround when the Support PC is not available on the SEM system.


<h2>Offline scripting configuration</h2>

In this configuration, all product components are installed on any PC, such as a personal laptop, and the Offline product license
is activated there. The offline environment is often used to create and pre-test scripts before running them on the real microscope.


<p><img height="211" src="Resources/OfflineScripting.png" width="271" alt=""></p>

The server will switch to simulation mode. It will simulate a dual beam system, i.e. a system that has both electron and ion beams. For most states of the microscope, the simulator will return cached values - whatever value is written will
be read back without checking the limits. Image acquisition functions return static images of the correct size and format.
AutoScript allows you to upload your own simulation images using the 
<a href="../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/sdb_microscope/_imaging/Imaging/set_image.html">imaging.set_image()</a> function.
This can be particularly useful for simulating parts of the workflow that involve image processing.

<h2>Client-only configuration</h2>

With this configuration, only the AutoScript client is installed on an arbitrary PC, e.g. a personal laptop, and the server installation is skipped completely.<br>

<p><img height="198" src="Resources/ClientOnlyScripting.png" width="162" alt=""></p>

The client component alone gives you the opportunity to explore the capabilities and "feel" of AutoScript at an elementary level
without actually being able to run the scripts.<br>

The Python editor will provide standard syntax checks and code completion hints for the API calls. 
Tools for managing the <a href="PythonDistribution.html">Python environment</a>, all documentation and the database of code examples
(<a href="Tooling.html">AutoScript Snippets</a>) will also be fully functional.
<br><br>
This configuration does not include any form of microscope simulation.<br>
No product license is required for this installation setup.
