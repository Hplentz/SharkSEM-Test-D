	<h1>Coordinate Systems</h1>
	
	<p>
	AutoScript uses numerical values to determine the position of objects in the microscope chamber or of geometric
	elements in an image. These coordinates are specified in coordinate systems that vary between AutoScript
	functional areas. This chapter lists the main coordinate systems in a typical SEM.
	</p>
    
	<h2>Stage coordinate system</h2>
	
	<p>
	The picture below shows the orientation of stage axes X, Y, Z, R and T. 
	The orientation of the Z axis is reversed when the "Link Z to FWD (free working distance)" function is activated.
	See <a href="../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/sdb_microscope/specimen/_stage/Stage/link.html">specimen.stage.link()</a>
	and <a href="../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/sdb_microscope/specimen/_stage/Stage/unlink.html">specimen.stage.unlink()</a> for details.
	</p>

    <h2>Scanning reduced area coordinate system</h2>
    
    <p>
    "Reduced area" is one of the <a href="../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/enumerations/ScanningMode/ScanningMode.html">supported scanning modes</a>.
    In this mode, the beam scans in a rectangular sub-region of the entire field of view.
    The area is specified by the coordinate of its upper left corner, width and height. 
    The upper left corner of the current field of view has the coordinate [0, 0], the lower right corner has the coordinate [1, 1].
    </p>

    <h2>Patterning coordinate system</h2>
    
    <p>
    Pattern shapes for patterning jobs are created in a special coordinate system that has its origin in the center
    of the field of view. The position and size of patterns are specified directly in distance units (meters) bounded
    by the current scan field width and height.
    </p>

    <h2>Imaging views numbering</h2>
    
    <p>
    AutoScript shares the concept of imaging views with the main microscope user interface application "Microscope Control".
    There are a total of 4 views with index 1 to 4, which divide the entire screen area into 4 quadrants of equal size.
    Each view can be configured with a specific beam type (called Imaging Device in AutoScript).
    In the Microscope Control application the views are positioned as follows:</p>
