<h1>PyCharm Editor</h1>

PyCharm is a dedicated Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com" target="_blank" >JetBrains</a>. It provides a wide range of essential tools for Python developers,
tightly integrated to create a convenient environment for productive data science development.
<br><br>

The AutoScript product includes the PyCharm editor in Community version.
A detailed user manual for PyCharm IDE can be found online on the vendor's website <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/2021.2/guided-tour-around-the-user-interface.html#action-indicators-and-action-list" target="_blank">https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm</a>.<br><br>

During product installation, PyCharm is optionally extended 
with custom plugins that provide AutoScript-specific functionality. Below is a screenshot of the PyCharm editor with AutoScript extensions installed:

<h3>Microscope API Browser</h3>

The panel visualizes the microscope API structure and allows you to easily navigate between objects,
their methods and properties. Double-clicking on an API element copies a code snippet to the editor area.
Double-clicking on the root elements copies the AutoScript initialization code to the editor.
Additional functions are available from the context menu.

<h3>Image Viewer</h3>

The panel can be used during code debugging to visualize the contents of variables of type <a href="../../autoscript_sdb_microscope_client/structures/AdornedImage/AdornedImage.html">AdornedImage</a>.
This is especially useful when applying image processing routines to the image, as you can immediately see the effects of the processing.<br>
To add a variable to the panel, type its name in the text box at the bottom or right-click the variable in the "Variables" tool window and choose "View as Image".

<h3>Integrated documentation</h3>

Pressing Shift + F1 while the cursor is on an API element, such as class, method or property, opens this reference manual to a page describing the details of the element,
often with usage examples.
